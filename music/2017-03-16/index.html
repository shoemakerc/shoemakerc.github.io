              For this first post, I figure that I should give an explanation as to why I've created this page.
              <br><br>
              When I was around 3 years old (being almost 20 years ago the exact details of this story are hazy), my parents placed a cello in my hands, brought me to a private music instructor, and told us to have at it. The results were less than satisfactory: a half hour and $50 of my parent's money was spent watching me lay on the floor, flatly refusing (in the aurally and visually pleasant style of a 3 year old) to be taught.
              <br><br>
              I did this twice.
              <br><br>
              Four years later, my elementary school's music program motivated my parents to try me again with the cello and learn the instrument in a less rebellious manner. What followed was what has been a fascinating journey, one that has included adding the piano at age 9, being a member of one of the <a class="body-link" href="https://mnyouthsymphonies.org">finest youth orchestras in the United States</a>, playing in other numerous fabulous ensembles, and having the privilege of being taught by a number of renowned instructors and performers.
              <br><br>
              The earliest memory I have as a music listener is listening at the age of 5 to Christy Moore's folk project Planxty and their compilation <em>The Planxty Collection</em> (Polydor, 1976) on a bootleg CD in my dad's car during a long road trip to Louisville, Kentucky (more on that entire adventure perhaps later). I guess one could say that this, too, triggered a sequence of one thing leading to another: being fed a steady diet of Beethoven, Mozart, and Nick Cave up to the age of 15, diving into the world of YouTube music videos <a class="body-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w">(a particular favorite of mine)</a>, and, finally, jumping into Spotify and its bottomless pit of licensed music.
              <br><br>
              What I intend for this blog to be is nothing more than something to show that music has been, and continues to be, a major part of my life. While this may sound a bit blunt, it's a simple a truth that I'll never deny. Moving forward, I'd like to add musical material to this page from different perspectives: as a listener, as a performer, and as a creator. Hopefully I can also transcend from this barebones blog look sooner or later.
              <br><br>
              In the meantime, feel free to take a look at what music I've been listening to this month at the bottom of this page. I update the playlist very frequently (switching it out entirely when the new month rolls around), and I hope that perhaps you'll pick out a tune and share in my joy of discovery.
