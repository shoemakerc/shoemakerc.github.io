    <br>
    I figure that as with any new page that I create in this website, I should give an introduction as to the purposes of this page.  I'll do my best to do so, along with an explanation as to why I've created this page.<br><br>
    When I was around 3 years old (being almost 20 years ago the exact details of this story are hazy), my parents placed a cello in my hands, brought me to a private music instructor, and told us to have at it.  The results were less than satisfactory: a half hour and at least $50 of my parent's money was spent watching me lay on the floor, flatly refusing (in the style of a 3 year old) to be taught.  <br><br>
    I did this twice.<br><br>
    Four years later, my primary school's music program motivated me to try again with the cello and begin learning the instrument in a less rebellious manner.  What followed was what has been a fascinating journey, one that has included adding the piano to my repertoire at age 9, being a member of one of the <a href=https://mnyouthsymphonies.org/>finest youth orchestras in the United States</a>, playing in other numerous fabulous ensembles, and having the privilege of being taught by a number of renowned instructors and performers.<br><br>
    My discovery of music as listener began a bit later than one might think.  One of the earliest memories that I still hold is listening to Christy Moore's folk project Planxty and their 1975 compilation <i>The Planxty Collection</i> on a copied CD in my dad's car on a long road trip to Louisville, Kentucky (more on that adventure perhaps later).  I guess one could say that this, too, triggered a sequence of one thing leading to another: being fed a steady diet of Beethoven, Mozart, and Nick Cave up to the age of 15, diving into the world of YouTube music videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w">(a particular favorite of mine)</a>, and, finally, jumping into Spotify and its bottomless pit of licensed music.<br><br>
    What I intend for this blog to be is nothing more than a visual to show that music has been, and continues to be, a major part of my life.  While this may sound a bit blunt, it is a truth that don't wish to ever deny.  Moving forward, I would like to add musical material to this page from different perspectives: as a listener, as a performer, and as a creator.  Hopefully I can eventually transcend from this barebones blog look as well (CSS/Bootstrap is still being worked on).<br><br>
  In the meantime, please check out what music I've been listening to recently at the bottom of this page.  I update the playlist very frequently, and I hope that perhaps you might pick out a tune there and share my joy of discovery.
