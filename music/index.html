                    Since the beginning of last week, I've been reading <em>The Rest is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century</em>, the first novel of <em>New Yorker</em> music critic Alex Ross. As hinted by the title, the book is a chronological examination of the politics and society surrounding different parts of twentieth-century Europe and America, as expressed in the works of the composers who lived during these often tumultuous times.
                    <br><br>
                    The book has certainly made its mark on the musicological world since its 2007 publication. In 2013, London's Southbank Centre hosted <a class="body-link" href="http://trin.southbankcentre.co.uk">a year-long exhibition</a> inspired by <em>The Rest is Noise</em>, featuring lectures on the forces that shaped the works of major twentieth century composers, interviews with people who lived in the various eras of twentieth century music (including modern-day composers and musicians), as well as a great number of performances of twentieth century works, presented by renowned musicians from all around the world. Furthermore, as the book cover proudly states, <em>The Rest is Noise</em> was chosen as one of <em>The New York Times</em>' <a class="body-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/10-best-2007.html">top 10 books of the year for 2007</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    My personal relationship with <em>The Rest is Noise</em> goes back to my first year of college, as it was the first assigned textbook that I used for my first undergraduate class. That course, titled Music and Politics in Europe since Wagner, focused primarily on a select number of composers from two primary center of twentieth-century upheaval in Germany and the Soviet Union, composers such as Mahler, Shostakovich, and Kurt Weill. Nevertheless, Ross' work was used in the class for more contextual learning. The assigned readings from <em>The Rest is Noise</em> were enough to want me to read the work cover-to-cover; sadly, for the next four years, I never got around to doing it. Finding myself now with a little more downtime than before, I dug this book out and will hopefully make my old goal a reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I'm a pretty slow reader, so I've so far only gotten through the first chapter. Titled "The Golden Age: Strauss, Mahler, and the Fin de Si√®cle," the chapter focuses on two leading figures of early-nineteenth-century Austro-German music: Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler. Deemed worthy adversaries by the former after the latter's death, the two composers were equally pioneers of post-Wagner Romanticism in Germany, and their paths often collided throughout their careers due in part to their subtle inter-competitiveness (I think the proper term to use is "frenemies"). Their individual paths to musical stardom, however, certainly have their distinguishing marks. Born into a difficult family life, Strauss quickly kicked off his composing career, writing his breakthrough work <em>Don Juan</em> at twenty-four, and spent the majority of his life determinedly breaking from the Wagnerian unification of art and religious symbolism and focusing on "immoral" ideas such as rebellion against the collective, notably by writing vibrant tone-poems that contained never-before-heard orchestration schemes and harkened to works by anarchist philosophers such as Max Stirner and other literary figures "of questionable reputation" (Ross 17). By contrast, the Austrian Mahler, whose career in composition was slower in progression, first adopted a similar form to Strauss' symphonic poems, though later sought to distinguish himself from his German counterpart by embracing more "traditional" Viennese music designs. Nevertheless, Mahler's desire to push the limits of his audiences' approval quickly drew him back away from so-called convention, as embodied by his peculiar Fifth and monstrous Sixth symphonies, the latter of which literally calls for a <a class="body-link" href="https://youtu.be/XE85zOSXJC4?t=20s">massive hammer to be pounded</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    What keeps me glued to <em>The Rest is Noise</em> is Ross' impressive ability to draw parallels between the classical works presented and the situation of the composer and/or the world at the time, eloquently detailing the commentaries embedded within the music. While one might say that such analysis is on par to any standard music critic, Ross dives deeper and draws upon the active relationships between composers and the influences upon apprentice composers of the future. Here in Chapter 1, we see this not only in the focus on the complex camaraderie between Mahler and Strauss, but also in the forging of style within the minds of composers-to-come, having witnessed the greatness of their idols. We see this, for instance, at the premiere of Strauss' <em>Salome</em>, where the attendance, as notes Ross, included young budding creators such as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg, who I can only guess will make an appearance later in the book.
                    <br><br>
                    The first 30-plus pages of Alex Ross' <em>The Rest is Noise</em> has been a packed and entertaining reading for me, as someone who was aware of many of the names included, but not much else. I hope that the rest of my reading, as I continue on to the second chapter: "Doctor Faust: Schoenberg, Debussy, and Atonality," will keep on with the riveting story-telling that Ross skillfully employs in the first. Given this first impression, I don't think I have too much to fear.

                    For this first post, I figure that I should give an explanation as to why I've created this page.
                    <br><br>
                    When I was around 3 years old (being almost 20 years ago the exact details of this story are hazy), my parents placed a cello in my hands, brought me to a private music instructor, and told us to have at it.
